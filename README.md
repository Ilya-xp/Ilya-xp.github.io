#About Me

##My Interests  
Sleep is very interesting to me. I can sleep for 8 hours and feel like I haven't slept enough. But then I sleep for 6 hours and feel refreshed. It might have to do with my mindset. 

##Websites I Recommend  

1. [**Epilepsy Warning!**](http://www.staggeringbeauty.com)  
I like that the warning for flashing images and loud noises is small so I just clicked okay. It scared me for a second. **Love it**. I rate this website 5/10. 
2. [Cat Bouncer](https://cat-bounce.com)  
The cats are cool looking. They can bounce. I rate this website 7/10.
